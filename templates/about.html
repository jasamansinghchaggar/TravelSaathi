<!-- Our Story -->

        <div class="col-12">
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>TravelSaathi was born out of a hackathon idea, where a group of passionate developers and travel enthusiasts came together to address the growing concerns around travel safety. What started as a project to create a simple drowsiness detection system has evolved into a comprehensive travel companion application.</p>
            <p>After witnessing the alarming statistics of road accidents caused by fatigue and lack of proper assistance during breakdowns, our team was determined to create a solution that could make a real difference in people's lives.</p>
            <p>Today, TravelSaathi combines various safety features including AI-powered drowsiness detection, mechanic assistance, emergency SOS, and road condition reporting to create the ultimate travel companion application.</p>
